I'm a third year undergraduate student from [College of Computer and Data Science](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/), [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/). My research interests encompass C++ programming, software engineering, and graph theory. I am currently immersed in studying C++ and its associated aspects of software engineering, where I have built a robust foundation in programming principles, data structures, and algorithms. My hands-on experience through various projects and coursework has significantly sharpened my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of software development processes.

I have developed a profound expertise in advanced algorithms and their applications and am now focusing on exploring graph theory in greater depth. In addition to my work in these areas, I have also gained a foundational understanding of computer architecture, computer networks, and operating systems. These insights have enhanced my comprehension of how software interacts with hardware and networks, and how operating systems manage resources and processes.

My aspiration is to channel this knowledge into a meaningful career in software engineering, where I can contribute to innovative projects and tackle complex challenges. To achieve this, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development through practical projects and advanced coursework. I envision myself growing into a versatile and impactful software engineer, leveraging my skills to drive technological advancements and create solutions that address real-world problems.
